    <h2>How to make this delicious meal in short</h3>
    <p>For this you will need to cut some veggies into smaller pieces. For example, I use spring onion, white onion, paprika of any color and corn.
        <br>
        The spring onion should be cut in small pieces, the white onion and paprika into lines. The corn can be put straight from the can.
    </p>
    <p>For the chicken I use clean breast and cut it also into small pieces. Spice it up with a fajita mix, fry it on the pan with some oil until it 
        <br>
        tastes like it's done and put the veggies and some sauce of your choice. Continue frying for a little whilte.
    </p>
    <p>Warm up the tortilla wraps in the device of your choice (I use the microwave or electril grill) and put the cooked ingredients inside. 
        <br>
        Add some grated cheddar cheese or any kind of your choice on top and close it up. Enjoy your meal!
